Task 1: Create DOM Input Elements Of Diffrenet types (Text, Number) using inheritence
Decission: Should I make the form with JS? Or should I create it normally using html?

Logic:
add simple button
button.onClick(
    {
        check which book?
            have book-no variable on every book
            
        remove the book.
    }
